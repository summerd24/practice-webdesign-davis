for practice at NTS.

I am a senior at MHS, and I am a cheer captain. We are going to Dallas, Texas for NCA nationals on January 19 through the 22. I am really excited and I hope we do well.

When I graduate, I plan to attend NCMC Savannah to obtain my RN, and afterwards get a BSN online. I currently have my CNA, which I got through the health science program here at the tech school. I enjoy being able to help others, so I'm excited to move forward with this career.

I currently live in Maryville, MO with my dad, step mom, and two siblings. I have 3 siblings in total, 2 brothers and 1 sister. I am sort of a middle child with the four of us since im the second oldest, but since one of them is already graduated, it seems like I am the oldest sibling since I live with my two younger siblings. We have 4 dogs, a yellow lab, a black lab, and two french bulldogs. Our house seems pretty crowded since there are 5 people and 4 dogs, but our house is big enough for all of us. I love my family and the place that I live.
